    "Melody": "A simple, almost chant-like melody that is instantly memorable and highly flexible for interpretation. It relies on small, repeated melodic phrases that build an emotional resonance, often climaxing on the high notes of the 'Hallelujah' refrain.",
    "Harmony": "Built around a famous, moving, and cyclical chord progression that expertly moves between major and minor keys. The use of the fourth chord (IV) and the subtle shifts create a powerful sense of longing and melancholic spirituality.",
    "Rhythm": "Very slow and loose, often determined by the lyrical delivery rather than a rigid beat. The acoustic guitar provides a consistent, flowing arpeggiated rhythm, while percussion is minimal, often just a subtle brush on a snare drum or an underlying bass pulse.",
    "Approximate BPM": "50-60 BPM",
    "track-song Key": "C Major (often in a modal variation)",
    "track-timeSignature": "4/4",
    "Chords": "Likely C, Am, F, G, Em. (Actual chords would require specific analysis of the harmony at different points).",
    "Lyrics In Song": "I heard there was a secret chord, that David played and it pleased the Lord, but you don't really care for music, do you? It goes like this: the fourth, the fifth, the minor fall, the major lift. The baffled king composing **Hallelujah**.",
